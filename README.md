## Trivia Quiz
---  

Trivia Quiz is a website designed to entertain and encourage the users to test their knowledge on different fields or subjects, answering different questions, challenging them to improve their performance with different difficulty levels.    
Before starting the game the user will be able to choose the category and the level of difficulty and then will start the question challenge. The question type is chosen randomly from the remote api, and can be a True/False or a multiple choice.
